## TaleemAI at a Glance

TaleemAI is a high-fidelity mobile prototype designed to support Pakistani high-school students who are preparing college applications without formal counselling. The experience blends verified peer mentorship, AI-assisted nudges, and curated admissions data so first-generation applicants can make informed choices despite limited institutional support.

## Motivation & Opportunity

- **Lack of formal counselling:** Interviews revealed that most colleges do not employ admissions counsellors, forcing applicants to rely on peers or relatives who often recycle outdated information.
- **Fragmented research workflow:** Students bounced between prospectuses, social media, and alumni messages; some boarding-school participants even missed deadlines when phones were confiscated during exam periods.
- **Socio-technical constraints:** Although 70% reported smartphone access, devices were frequently shared and internet speeds were inconsistent, making it difficult to track requirements and scholarships.

## My Role

- Led formative research with seniors, alumni, and gap-year applicants to surface the institutional and socio-technical barriers they face.
- Translated insights into experience principles that kept guidance trustworthy, easy to follow, and resilient even when students had limited access to shared devices.
- Facilitated FigJam ideation, storyboarding, and low-fi prototyping sessions to compare product directions before converging on a mobile app.
- Built the high-fidelity prototype and component library, ensuring visual consistency across applicant and buddy flows.
- Planned and moderated usability tests that informed navigation changes, clearer AI cues, and a dedicated buddy registration flow.

## Core Functionality

- **Guided Onboarding & Dual Modes:** Distinct applicant and buddy pathways verify current university students while tailoring support for applicants seeking mentorship.
- **Buddy Connect:** Authenticated mentors answer questions, offer realistic campus insights, and can be filtered by university or expertise.
- **Scholarship & Deadline Hub:** Centralised workspace keeps upcoming deadlines, bookmarked universities, and funding opportunities glanceable with reminders.
- **University Explorer:** Structured program pages aggregate admission requirements, alumni spotlights, and quick links to official sources.
- **TaleemAI Assistant:** Contextual chatbot supplements human mentors with quick answers and nudges when device access is limited.
- **Community Forum:** Applicants learn from peer threads while highlighted buddy responses signal trusted guidance.

## Iterative Design Process

1. **Discovery:** Conducted interviews and secondary research on guidance interventions to map institutional and cultural barriers.
2. **Ideation:** Used FigJam to explore alternatives (web hub, mentorship marketplace, AI-only concierge, gamified guidance) and selected a hybrid mentor + AI mobile approach.
3. **Prototyping:** Converted scenarios into storyboards, paper prototypes, and low-fi flows to validate information hierarchy and mentorship mechanics.
4. **Refinement:** Built the high-fidelity prototype, introduced clear Applicant/Buddy flows, and tuned AI assistant microcopy based on usability feedback.

## Validation & What Changed

- Clarified the conversational assistant by pairing the floating avatar with onboarding microcopy—testers no longer misinterpreted its purpose.
- Elevated the “Saved Deadlines” heading and contrast so the tracker was immediately understood during evaluative sessions.

## Looking Ahead

Future iterations will pilot moderated community prompts, prototype offline reminders for boarders with limited device windows, and explore partnerships with university outreach offices to sustain the buddy network.
